# test_game
test_game is a project to improve my C++ skills and hopefully make a funny game as a result. Here I try to develop game from scratch without using any game engines, only C++ and SFML library.
It is my first gamedev experience, do not judge strictly.
## Remark
Now build system configured only for Windows x86_64 and > Visual C++ 15 (2017) version.<br />
Game developed and tested only on and for Full HD (1920x1080) monitor. Optimising for a different resolution is a task for later.
